### Image tags

Image tags are named using the following pattern:

```text
public.ecr.aws/jsii/superchain:<JSII-MAJOR>-<BASE>(-node<NODE-MAJOR>)(-nightly)
```

- `<JSII-MAJOR>` is the major line of the jsii toolchain (currently only `1`)
- `<BASE>` is the base image tag, currently supported base images are
- `<NODE-MAJOR>` is the major version of Node.js contained in the image
- `-nightly` images are released from the `HEAD` of the [`aws/jsii`][jsii]
  repository and should typically not be used for production workloads

## Support policy

Generally only actively versions that are actively supported by upstream projects are maintained in superchain.

### Debian

We only publish images for [Debian releases under LTS](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases#Production_Releases) (but not ELTS).
All `superchain` images are based on the slim variant.

### Node

We publish images variants for stable Node versions supported by the [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/node-versions.html).
Usually this means all even Node versions until six month after their EOL.
We will only add new Node variants to the latest Debian release.
We include the npm version that ships with the version of Node.
Tags without an explicit `-nodeXX` segment use the current [Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) version of Node.

### Python

The image includes the most recent Python version available for the respective Debian distribution.
A complete list can be viewed on the [Debian website](https://wiki.debian.org/Python#Supported_Python_Versions).

## Building

This docker image can be build locally:

```console
docker build ./superchain -t jsii/superchain:local
```

In case the tests fail, skip the tests and inspect the image manually:

```console
docker build ./superchain -t jsii/superchain:local --target=superchain
```

### NodeJS and NPM

If you are building this image from source, you can control the Node version with the
`NODE_MAJOR_VERSION` build argument:

```console
docker build [...] --build-arg NODE_MAJOR_VERSION=22
```

## Releasing

Changes are not automatically released.
Instead a new preview images `public.ecr.aws/jsii/superchain:1-bullseye-slim-nightly` is released weekly.

A full release (the `public.ecr.aws/jsii/superchain:1-bullseye-slim` images) is done monthly, or whenever a new release is cut manually.

The latest release information (for both of the container image tags) can be seen on the [Amazon ECR Public Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/jsii/superchain).

To manually kick-off a full or preview release, start the [Tag Preview](https://github.com/aws/jsii-superchain/actions/workflows/tag-preview.yml) or [Tag Release](https://github.com/aws/jsii-superchain/actions/workflows/tag-release.yml) workflow respectively.

## License

As with all Docker images, these also contain software which may be distributed
under various licenses (such as Bash, etc from the base distribution, along with
any direct or indirect dependencies of the primary software being contained).

As for any pre-built image usage, it is the image user's responsibility to
ensure that any use of this image complies with any relevant licenses for all
software contained within.

For more information, refer to the `/NOTICE` file that is present in the Docker
image.

## FAQ

Q: The docker build is failing because it cannot access `proxy.golang.org`, how do I fix this?
A: By default, Go attempts to use a module proxy, which caches modules to accelerate downloads. However, some network configurations block this proxy. Run `go env -w GOPROXY=direct` to download from source.

Q: During docker image build, why do I see a warning like: "WARNING: Maven ${M2_VERSION} not found on downloads mirror, falling back to archive.apache.org"?
A: This indicates that `M2_VERSION` has fallen behind the latest version of Maven. Update `M2_VERSION` to the latest version to address this. We first attempt to download the Maven version matching `M2_VERSION` from the regular distro: <https://downloads.apache.org/maven/maven-3>. However, when new versions are released, older versions are removed from that distro. We emit this warning and fall back to the archive link: <https://archive.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3>.
